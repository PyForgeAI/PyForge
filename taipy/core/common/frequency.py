    """Frequency of the recurrence of `Cycle^` and `Scenario^` objects.

    This enumeration can have the following values:

    - `DAILY`: Daily frequency, a new cycle is created for each day.
    - `WEEKLY`: Weekly frequency, a new cycle is created for each week (from Monday to Sunday).
    - `MONTHLY`: Monthly frequency, a new cycle is created for each month.
    - `QUARTERLY`: Quarterly frequency, a new cycle is created for each quarter.
    - `YEARLY`: Yearly frequency, a new cycle is created for each year.

    The frequency must be provided in the `ScenarioConfig^`.

    Each recurrent scenario is attached to the cycle corresponding to the creation date and the
    frequency. In other words, each cycle represents an iteration and contains the various scenarios
    created during this iteration.

    For instance, when scenarios have a _MONTHLY_ frequency, one cycle will be created for each
    month (January, February, March, etc.). A new scenario created on February 10th, gets
    attached to the _February_ cycle.
