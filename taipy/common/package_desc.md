## What is PyForge Config

PyForge is a Python library for creating Business Applications. More information on our
[website](https://www.pyforge.io). PyForge is split into multiple packages including *pyforge-common*
to let users install the minimum they need.

PyForge Config is a package designed to help users configure their PyForge application.

## Installation

The latest stable version of *pyforge-common* is available through *pip*:
```bash
pip install pyforge-common
```

You can install the development version of *pyforge-common* with *pip* and *git* via the pyforge repository:
```bash
pip install git+https://git@github.com/Avaiga/pyforge
```

This command installs the development version of *pyforge* package in the Python environment with all
its dependencies, including the *pyforge-common* package.

If you need the source code for *pyforge-common* on your system so you can see how things are done or
maybe participate in the improvement of the packages, you can clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avaiga/pyforge.git
```

This creates the 'pyforge' directory holding all the package's source code, and the 'pyforge-common'
source code is in the 'pyforge/common' directory.
