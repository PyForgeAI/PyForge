# Front-end source code

This directory contains the source code for the front-end parts of PyForge GUI and PyForge.

- `./pyforge-gui`: The source files for building the front-end part of PyForge GUI.<br/>
  This includes the web application used by PyForge GUI to expose user interfaces as
  well as all the visual elements, implemented in React.
- `./pyforge`: The source files for building the front-end part of PyForge.<br/>
  This includes all the PyForge elements for Scenario Management.

Note that before the `pyforge` part is built, the `pyforge-gui` part must have been built.

Please check the [PyForge GUI Front-end](pyforge-gui/README.md) and [PyForge Front-end](pyforge/README.md)
README files for details.
